This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an element beyond the vector's bounds.  The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides the corrected code.  This error is easily made and can lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes.  Understanding how to correctly iterate over vectors is crucial for writing robust C++ code.
